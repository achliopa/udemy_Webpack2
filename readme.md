## Section 2 - What Does Webpack Do

### Lecture 3 - Why do we use build tools

* webpack popularity goes hand in hand with rich web apps, apps with a lot of dynamic feats
* Server Side Templating: backend server creates an HTML document and sends it to the user. FLow: 
	* User visits page
	* HTTP request to server
	* New HTML document
	* User Clicks a link
	* HTTP request to server
	* New HTML doc
* Single Page App. Backend sends barebone html doc. javascript runs on users browser and assembles a full webpage. App flow: 
	* User visits page
	* HTTP request to server
	* New HTML document
	* React/Angular boots up, shows the page
	* User clicks link
	* React/Angular shows new content
* Single Page Applications are rising up in popularity
* In single page apps we rely on js code, a large pile of code sent to browser to run the app

### Lecture 4 - Javascript Modules

* having a big project split in only some big files is not maintenable.
* we strive to do it modular . have many small files in our codebase in e.g  a components folder and an api folder
